# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection
This is a model that helps us in early detection of diabetic retinopathy<br><br>
Here is a general overview of this project : -
1) Data Collection
2) Pre-Preocessing
3) Network Architecutre
4) Training
5) Evaluation & Deployment

This is a team project of 4 members, where I played a role in Data Augmentation (scaling, rotating and flipping) and Data Generation(same height and width of images) <br>

I wont be able to upload the test datasets here on GitHub due to the large size, but here is a link below which can guide you to the datasets from kaggle <br>
